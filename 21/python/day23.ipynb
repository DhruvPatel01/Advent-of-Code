    "So state can be described as a list of 23 elements. 4\\*4 Amphipods, and 7 unoccpied. Unoccupied is denoted as 100.\n",

    "\n",
    "### First Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "I (implicitly) created a dense graph. This meant each node(state) all possible neighbours were allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means that if some room had 3 Amphipods, `XYZ.` (dot being at bottom), I had allowed `XY.Z`. This created a dense graph. Similarly `XY.Z` had `X.YZ` and `XYZ.` as neightbours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, I also allowed neighbours that violated rules of the Amphipod. E.g. if A is at hallway X, it was allowed to roam at X+2 or X-2 (provided that is was not occupied). This violated the rule that Amphipod's are allowed to stop only once in the hallway.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approch quickly filled memory (7GB in around a minute). So had to be improved. I am really embarassed that I didn't read the rules carefully, they have given so many hints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Second approach (mapping of English rules to state space)\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can only move from room to hallway, and hallway to room.\n",
    "* You can only move to bottomest allowed position if you are moving into a room.\n",
    "* You can't enter the room if it is occupied by some other variety of amphipod.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, I felt that the rules described in the puzzle were arbitrary. But after my failed first approach, I realized that these rules made the statespace quite small so that it can be explored with small enough computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Possible improvements:\n",
    "A* search. A variation of L1 distance as heuristic."
