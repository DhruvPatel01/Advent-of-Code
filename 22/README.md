# Day 18
Part two required me to extend the default recursion limit to 10000, 
a number which I arrived by multiplying 21*21*21, a maximum width of
all coordinates.

However, after getting the result, I changed the notebook code to iterative
solution. The original code, as always, is in `original.py`. The notebook
contains this iterative version.
